[pytest]
# ===========================
# Default options
# ===========================
# Set command-line options for pytest runs:
#   -v : verbose output (shows each test method name and status)
#   -s : disables output capturing, so print/log messages appear live
#   --self-contained-html : generates a standalone HTML report, includes CSS/JS directly
addopts = -v -s --self-contained-html

# ===========================
# Test discovery
# ===========================
# Specify where pytest should look for test files
# All test_xxx.py or xxx_test.py files inside this folder (and subfolders) will be run.
testpaths = tests

# ===========================
# Custom markers
# ===========================
# Define custom test markers for organizing and selecting tests:
# Markers can be used to run specific groups, e.g.:
#   pytest -m smoke        # Runs only smoke tests
#   pytest -m admin        # Runs only admin functionality tests
markers =
    smoke: mark a test as smoke test
    regression: mark a test as regression test
    admin: mark a test as admin functionality
    manager: mark a test as manager functionality  
    employee: mark a test as employee functionality
    dashboard: mark a test as dashboard functionality
    revenue: mark a test as revenue panel functionality
    employees: mark a test as employee management functionality
    timesheet: mark a test as timesheet functionality
    project: mark a test as project management functionality
    order(order): mark test to run in specified order

# ===========================
# Report behavior
# ===========================
# Controls whether HTML report will automatically open after a test run.
# If true: opens HTML report in browser after finishing (can be overridden by CLI).
auto_open_report = false

# ===========================
# Logging behavior
# ===========================
# Configure Pytest's live logging:
#   log_cli = true         # Enables live log output on console during test execution
#   log_cli_level = INFO   # Sets log level for console output (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, etc.)
#   log_cli_format         # Sets formatting for log messages
#   log_cli_date_format    # Sets date/time format for each log message
log_cli = true
log_cli_level = INFO
log_cli_format = %(asctime)s [%(levelname)s] %(name)s: %(message)s
log_cli_date_format = %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S
